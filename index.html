									<h2>My name is Troy Vaughn</h2>
									<p>I am a qualified Diploma of Software Development graduate with several years of self-taught software
										and hobbyist game development to my name. My primary programming languages are Java and C# (Winforms, .Net) 
										with some additionale experience in SQL database design and minimal html/web design experience. My main fields 
										of interest are game design & gameplay programming as well as front end and UI develolpment. <br/>
										I am passionate not only about software & game development but how software, games and technology can 
										change people's lives.<br/> The following portfolio outlines a number of my recent projects to showcase
										my skills and abilities and to demonstrate the versatility of my work</p>

								<h2>BOOM v1.0</h2>
								<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>Boom is a game prototype developed as a part of my Diploma of Software Development assessment work. The base 
									structure for the game and level generation algorithm was developed over the span of a week using the Unity Game 
									Engine with all aspects of the game's programming and asset development done by myself personally. The game is a rogue
									like influenced by the early Bomberman games in which the player character traverses the level planting stationary
									bombs to destroy enemies and other destructible elements. Each game randomly generates a path through the levels from
									the start to the end point filling the path with various rooms taken from a randomised set with each room having 
									additional randomised elements such as additional walls and structures and enemy types and placements. The game runs 
									continueosly until death in its current iteration generating levels as the player progresses. However, further 
									additions to this game will include additional enemy and object types as well as developing a more structured level 
									progression with region based tile sets and game ending and potential boss level goals.

									<p>
										A small pixel-based drawing application to assist young children develop their hand eye coordination 
										and fine motor skills developed as an assessment for part of my software development diploma. 
										Developed using Netbeans for Java this project was also an experiment on showing the versatility of different
										elements of the Java Swing library with the drawing grid being entirely created by utilising a 2d array of text fields which are manipulated 
										by the user's inputs to draw the image on screen. Initially th project requirements were only for pressing a single square at a time  per
										mouse press which proved to be time consuming when trying to generate a drawing so further iterations added additional drawing states 
										allowing for faster drawing based upon a common interface allowing click and drag mechanics to add pen drawing and box drawing modes as well 
										as a color swap mode allowing the complete change of any colour in the drawing for a ne colour.

									<p>
										A CD Archive managment system project developed as part of my Software Development Diploma. This system utilises a primary 
										dashboard which allows the user to add and and modify details of archive hard copies stored in a secondary location. This dashboard
										also allows communication to a secondary automation console system which currently acts as an interface for an automated retrieval
										system located at the main archive. The automated system at present simply receives and processes orders when prompted and sends 
										processing confirmations back to the primary dashboard. This whole system manages its communications over a local network by use of a 
										chat server system to relay messages between the two systems.

									<p>
										A prototype tool rentals and inventory management system. Allows for report generating stock managament
										as well as comprehensive tool histories and conditions reports. Developed using Winforms this system connects to a SQL database to
										manage the tool and client records as well as manage queries used to display records within the application. The application allows for 
										exporting of CSV reports upon given filters to display tools based upon working conditions and or loan status to help the client better manage 
										their inventory.
